# Expert Workshop on Topic Models and Corpus Analysis: Call for Participation
## Organised by DARIAH Text &amp; Data Analytics Working Group (TDAWG)

## Date

December 14th (full-day) and 15th (half-day) 2015

## Venue

ADAPT Centre Dublin City University, Glasnevin, Dublin 9 Ireland

## Information

With the increasing availability of large digital text resources, quantitative methods of analysis have found their way into a wide range of humanities disciplines and increasingly allow supplementing, and framing qualitative approaches in quantitative terms, leveraging the properties of large-scale data resources. Special relevance in this respect belongs to Natural Language Processing as a core sub-discipline of computer science. Recent advances in statistical approaches to recognising word embeddings and topic models have been leveraged successfully by scholars in diverse areas such as history, literary studies and linguistics.

The DARIAH NLP-WG invite participation from practitioners, researchers, scholars and experts in areas including topic modelling, word embedding, literary scholarship, history and the digital humanities. A portion of the workshop will be dedicated to organising and planning future WG activities, both Virtual and Physical.

This expert workshop agenda will include position papers and experience reports on the use of corpus analysis and topic modelling tools, their implications in different domains.
