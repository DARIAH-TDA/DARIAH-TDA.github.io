 At our second virtual meeting, a question arose about the perception
of the name of the working group. There is a concern that a perception
of unnecessary duplication of effort between CLARIN and DARIAH might
exist. In particular, this arises on the development of tools and
resources in the natural language processing domain.
 A second concern about the NLP name is that it risks being perceived
as too technical and somewhat obscure for humanities scholars.

 Given both of these concerns, and in the interests of broader
inclusiveness, it was decided to alter the name of the group to account
for a more DH-oriented engagement. It was decided that the working group
would be renamed the "WG on Text &amp; Data Analytics".

 It is our hope that this would be the best of both worlds: broadening
participation while reinforcing the unique contribution that DARIAH
has to the application of digital methods to textual scholarship.
