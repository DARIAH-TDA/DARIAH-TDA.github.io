## Organised by DARIAH Text &amp; Data Analytics Working Group (TDAWG)

## Date

December 14<sup>th</sup> (full-day) and 15<sup>th</sup> (half-day) 2015

## Venue

ADAPT Centre Dublin City University, Glasnevin, Dublin 9 Ireland

## Information

With the increasing availability of large digital text resources, quantitative methods of analysis have found their way into a wide range of humanities disciplines and increasingly allow supplementing, and framing qualitative approaches in quantitative terms, leveraging the properties of large-scale data resources. Special relevance in this respect belongs to Natural Language Processing as a core sub-discipline of computer science. Recent advances in statistical approaches to recognising word embeddings and topic models have been leveraged successfully by scholars in diverse areas such as history, literary studies and linguistics.

The DARIAH NLP-WG invite participation from practitioners, researchers, scholars and experts in areas including topic modelling, word embedding, literary scholarship, history and the digital humanities. A portion of the workshop will be dedicated to organising and planning future WG activities, both Virtual and Physical.

This expert workshop agenda will include position papers and experience reports on the use of corpus analysis and topic modelling tools, their implications in different domains.

## Keynote

### Machine Translation and Cognition: Perception, Productivity and the Professional

Recent advances in data driven machine translation have resulted in
considerable levels of deployment in commercial translation scenarios, with
reasonable success for some language pairs and domains. Consequently,
professional translators find themselves engaged with a new paradigm, which is
at least as disruptive as the translation memory revolution that took place in the
1990s. An uneasy symbiosis has emerged between the professional translator
and the machine, with organisational and technological aspects potentially
playing a significant role in the acceptance or rejection of the technology. While
professional translators struggle with the new paradigm, consumers of content
find themselves in a position where they can translate at the click of a button, at
least for gisting purposes. The growth of machine translation has, therefore,
impacted many. This talk will focus on machine translation from a cognitive
ergonomic viewpoint moving through the stages of MT evaluation, to post-
editing and its support technologies, to usability assessment for end users.

### Speaker Bio

Sharon O'Brien is a senior lecturer in translation and language technology in the
School of Applied Language and Intercultural Studies, Dublin City University. Her
research to date has focused on the interaction between translators and
technology (including Translation Memory and Machine Translation), cognitive
aspects of translation, research methods, including eye tracking and keyboard
logging, localisation and content authoring. She is Director of the Centre for
Translation and Textual Studies (www.ctts.dcu.ie) and a funded investigator in
the cross-institutional research centre Adapt (www.cngl.ie). She previously
worked as a language technology specialist in the localisation industry.
